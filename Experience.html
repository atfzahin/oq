<li>Be A Champion In Football Competition</li>
<p>In 2017, I represented my school in the high school football tournament and for the first time in my life, I helped my schoool win the championship and also created a new history for my school. At the same time, I have been selected to represent the district level. I am so glad and happy becuase I have achieved various of achievements throughout the year of 2017 in football.</p>

<li>Lost My Loved One</li>
<p>In 2006, I lost a loved one of my beloved mother who died of a fever. It was too early for me to losing him because I was really young that time. I cannot longer feel the love of a real mother from now on and forever. I need to move on and learn to accept fate.</p>
